  <h1>His Accomplishments</h1>

  <p>Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times but never actually received anything. However, he received lots of other things, including the Time Magazine's Man of the Year in 1930, and the Bharat Ratna, after his death, in 1966 by the Indian government.</p>
