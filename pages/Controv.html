  <h1>Controversy</h1>

  <p>Even though Gandhi liberated all of India he is still present in some controversy. Some people look at his views on black people during his time in South Africa, where he said some pretty disrespectful stuff ("[Black People] are troublesome, very dirty and live like animals."). Also he was a pedophile.</p>
